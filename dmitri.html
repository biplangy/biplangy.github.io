        Embittered, headstrong and impulsive, 27-year-old Dmitri (or Mitya) feuds with his father <span class="tag" id="fyodorTag"><a href="#fyodor">Fyodor</a></span> over his inheritance from his mother â€“ Fyodor's first wife, who abandoned them. Raised in his infancy by the servant <span class="tag" id="grigoryTag"><a href="#grigory">Grigory</a></span> and a cousin of his mother, Dmitri emerged from his distant father's household to lead a wild life, as a military captain and a spendthrift. Now that the alluring <span class="tag" id="agrafenaTag"><a href="#agrafena">Agrafena</a></span> has caught his eye, it is imperative for him to gain his fair share of money to fund an elopement; but, he is not the only one with eyes on her.
